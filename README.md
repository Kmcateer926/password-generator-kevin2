Beth Presten helped me with finalizing my code. Before our study session, my application only yielded one character results. My code was similar to hers, but she had key elements that I was missing, such as '+= (type of character) and I had elements that I didn't need at, such as 'var confirmUppercase' and trying to assign an array. instead I made a var of strings for each criteria. Thanks to her, my code generates the full length of characters.
